# life-expectancy

Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. It is formally defined as an estimate of the average age that a member of a particular population will be when they die.
This project aims to analyze global life expectancy trends from 2000 to 2015, recognizing its significance as a measure of a country's overall health and well-being. By examining various factors such as income, education, healthcare expenditure, disease prevalence, and lifestyle habits, we seek to identify the key drivers behind the improvements in life expectancy observed over the past two decades.The dataset used comprises 2938 observations, providing a rich source of information for assessing changes in life expectancy over time. 
Our analysis will explore the relationship between life expectancy and factors like adult and infant mortality, alcohol consumption, healthcare expenditure, and education to determine their impact on lifespan.
problem statement
